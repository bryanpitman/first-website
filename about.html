        <p>I was a highly adaptable Property Damage Operations Manager at GEICO, trusted for almost a decade to scale out the business in regional areas with the most growth potential in the Bay Area. During my tenure, I had to solve complex issues in the most highly regulated state in the United States. This experience required constant communications with my direct team which consisted of 8 members of management with 50 locally and remote staffed employees including 30 direct partner repair facilities partners that were contracted to repair vehicles. </p>
        <p>The notion of reinventing myself after a decade of experience in management has been a journey of discovery. </p>
        <p>Working with code has been far more engaging than anything I have ever done in the past. The overwhelming feeling of satisfaction when my code works is something I want to chase every day. I have caught myself spending hours on the computer, deep in thought, losing track of time, while trying to solve problems. If you were to ask me a few months ago, “how does an application on your phone work?” I would have simply said “magic”. Now that I’ve seen what it’s like to actually build one, I want to be a contributor/magician who works behind the scenes to continue to further advance technology that is central to everyday life.</p>
