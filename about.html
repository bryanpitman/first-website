      <p id="firstParagraph">I was a highly adaptable Property Damage Operations Manager at GEICO, trusted for almost a
        decade to scale out the business in regional areas with the most growth potential in the Bay Area. During my
        tenure, I had to solve complex issues in the most highly regulated state in the United States. This experience
        required constant communications with my direct team which consisted of 8 members of management with 50 locally
        and remote staffed employees including 30 direct partner repair facilities partners that were contracted to
        repair vehicles. </p>

        <p id="thirdParagraph">Working with code has been far more engaging than anything I have ever done in the past.
          The overwhelming feeling of satisfaction when my code works is something I want to chase every day. I have
          caught myself spending hours on the computer, deep in thought, losing track of time, while trying to solve
          problems. If you were to ask me a few months ago, “how does an application on your phone work?” I would have
          simply said “magic”. Now that I’ve seen what it’s like to actually build one, I want to be a
          contributor/magician who works behind the scenes to continue to further advance technology that is central to
          everyday life.</p>
